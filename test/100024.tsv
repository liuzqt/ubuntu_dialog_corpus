2008-08-28T03:03:00.000Z	baliktad		My Ubuntu 8.04.1 server box grinds to a halt every 3-4 days, requiring a restart to recover.  I'm not sure what's causing it, what should I do to find the cause?
2008-08-28T03:04:00.000Z	Expl0ited	baliktad	have you checked your syslogs?
2008-08-28T03:05:00.000Z	baliktad	Expl0ited	I'm not sure what to check, there didn't seem to be anything relevant in /var/log/messages, and I don't know where else to look
