2009-03-12T12:14:00.000Z	Neaai		Hi. I have a pc with a Core2 Quad Intel. As it's a 64 bit processor, I was to download the 64 bit ubuntu cd from the site. But the filename to be saved has a name like "ubuntu-amd64.iso".   Is that AMD part of the name signifficant, when what I have is an Intel cpu ?
